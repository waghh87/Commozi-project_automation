## New in v0.5.0

### Test Retry Analysis

Track tests that require multiple attempts to pass. The report now identifies tests with high retry rates, helping you spot unreliable tests that pass inconsistently.

- Automatically detects tests that passed only after retries
- Shows retry count for each test
- Highlights tests that exceed the retry threshold (default: 3)
- Helps identify flaky tests that might pass/fail randomly

### Failure Clustering

Automatically groups similar failures together by analyzing error messages and stack traces. This makes it easier to identify patterns and common root causes across multiple test failures.

- Groups failures by error type (timeout, assertion, network, etc.)
- Shows count of similar failures in each cluster
- Helps prioritize fixes by identifying widespread issues
- Reduces noise when debugging multiple failures

### Stability Scoring

Comprehensive health metrics that give each test a stability score from 0-100 with letter grades (A+ to F).

- **A+ (95-100)**: Rock solid, consistently passing
- **A (90-94)**: Very stable with rare failures
- **B (80-89)**: Generally stable with occasional issues
- **C (70-79)**: Moderately stable, needs attention
- **D (60-69)**: Unstable, frequent failures
- **F (<60)**: Critically unstable, requires immediate attention

Scores are calculated based on:
- Pass rate over recent runs
- Retry frequency
- Performance consistency
- Failure patterns

### Attachment Gallery

New gallery view displaying all test attachments (screenshots, videos, traces) in an organized grid layout.

- Visual grid of all screenshots from test runs
- Quick access to videos and trace files
- Filter by test status or file name
- Thumbnail previews with click-to-expand
- Trace Viewer integration - open `.zip` traces directly in Playwright's trace viewer

### Run Comparison

Compare the current test run against a baseline to see exactly what changed.

- Side-by-side comparison of test results
- Highlights new failures, new passes, and regressions
- Shows performance changes (faster/slower)
- Identifies newly added or removed tests
- Configure baseline using `baselineRunId` option

### Smart Recommendations

AI-powered actionable insights based on your test results. The reporter analyzes patterns and provides specific recommendations:

- Suggests tests to investigate based on failure patterns
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Recommends retry configuration adjustments
- Highlights flaky tests that need stabilization
- Provides priority-ranked action items

### Merge History CLI

New command-line tool for combining test histories from parallel CI runs.

```bash
# Merge histories from multiple parallel shards
npx playwright-smart-reporter-merge-history history1.json history2.json -o merged.json

# Use glob patterns for multiple files
npx playwright-smart-reporter-merge-history 'blob-reports/**/test-history.json' -o test-history.json --max-runs 10
```

This is essential for maintaining accurate history when running tests in parallel across multiple machines or shards.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D playwright-smart-reporter
```

## Usage

Add to your `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['playwright-smart-reporter', {

## CI Integration

### Persisting History Across Runs

For flakiness detection and performance trends to work in CI, you need to persist `test-history.json` between runs.

#### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Restore test history
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: test-history.json
    key: test-history-${{ github.ref }}
    restore-keys: |
      test-history-

- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npx playwright test

- name: Save test history
  uses: actions/cache/save@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    path: test-history.json
    key: test-history-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.run_id }}
```

#### GitLab CI

```yaml
test:
  cache:
    key: test-history-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    paths:
      - test-history.json
    policy: pull-push
  script:
    - npx playwright test
```

#### CircleCI

```yaml
- restore_cache:
    keys:
      - test-history-{{ .Branch }}
      - test-history-

- run: npx playwright test

- save_cache:
    key: test-history-{{ .Branch }}-{{ .Revision }}
    paths:
      - test-history.json
```

### CI Environment Detection

The reporter automatically detects CI environments and enriches history with:
- **Run ID** - Unique identifier for the run
- **Branch** - Current branch name
- **Commit** - Short commit SHA
- **CI Provider** - GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps

This metadata is stored with each run for debugging and audit purposes.

### Webhook Notifications

Configure Slack or Teams webhooks to receive notifications when tests fail:

```typescript
reporter: [
  ['playwright-smart-reporter', {
    slackWebhook: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL,
    teamsWebhook: process.env.TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL,
  }],
]
```

Notifications include:
- Summary of passed/failed tests
- List of first 5 failed test names
- Only sent when there are failures

### Merging Reports from Multiple Machines

When running tests in parallel across multiple machines (sharding), you can merge both the test results and history files.

#### 1. Configure each machine to output blobs and history

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
const outputDir = process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR || 'blob-report';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['blob'],
    ['playwright-smart-reporter', {
      outputFile: `${outputDir}/smart-report.html`,
      historyFile: `${outputDir}/test-history.json`,
    }],
  ],
});
```

#### 2. Run tests on each machine

```bash
# Machine 1
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR=blob-reports/machine1 npx playwright test --shard=1/2

# Machine 2
PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR=blob-reports/machine2 npx playwright test --shard=2/2
```

#### 3. Merge history files

```bash
npx playwright-smart-reporter-merge-history \
  blob-reports/machine1/test-history.json \
  blob-reports/machine2/test-history.json \
  -o blob-reports/merged/test-history.json
```

#### 4. Merge blob reports

```bash
cp blob-reports/machine1/*.zip blob-reports/machine2/*.zip blob-reports/merged/
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter=playwright-smart-reporter blob-reports/merged
```

The merged report will include all tests from all machines with unified history for flakiness detection and trend charts.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run demo tests
npm run test:demo

# Open the report
open example/smart-report.html
```

### Merge History CLI

When running tests in parallel across multiple machines or CI shards, use the merge history CLI tool to combine test histories:

```bash
# Merge parallel test histories
npx playwright-smart-reporter-merge-history history1.json history2.json -o merged.json

# Use with glob patterns
npx playwright-smart-reporter-merge-history 'blob-reports/**/test-history.json' -o test-history.json --max-runs 10
```

This ensures your flakiness detection and performance trends work correctly even with parallelized test execution. The merged history maintains all the metadata from individual runs while deduplicating test results.
